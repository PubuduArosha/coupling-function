CDE IT Solutions is a startup and is evolving rapidly. At present, they only concentrate on developing C++ and Java based
projects. The primary objective of CDE IT solutions is to build quality software that could be easily maintained. Assume your
group is working for CDE IT solutions. In an attempt to reduce the maintenance cost of the software developed by the company,
the CEO has requested your group to develop a web-based code complexity measuring tool. Accordingly, he wants to
measure the complexity introduced due to the following factors:

  a. Size, variables, and methods
  b. Inheritance
